# Spark Fund Investment Case Study based on Global trends
Investing money is an art and always investment should be rational, sensible, quantified, logical etc. Spark Funds is an asset management fund and want to invest in few companies by identifying the best sector, country and suitable investment Type. In this project based on my understanding, details and data provided, I have come out with the solution of where to actually invest money based on some constraint provided by Spark funds.
Here I applied CRISP-DM framework in order to select best sector and country. Steps Involved are : -
Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Data Preparation
Data Modelling
Model evaluation
Model Deployment

## Investment Strategy Process
1. Business Understanding - Understanding the business objective and data gathering
2. Data Analysis - Need to understand the data present in different files after reading the data and creating the data frames.
3. Data Preparation - Data Preparation by structuring, cleaning and merging of data 
4. Data Modelling - Modelling the data so that it should sound efficient and easy to use.
5. Model evaluation/ Deployment - Evaluation to ensure that the model is robust and effective 

## Funding types analysis
In order to understand Companies and Round Dataset first we need to fetch the unique key and based on that need to understand the common companies and corresponding data to it. Now we need to merge those Dataset as one Dataset based on the unique key. From merge table calculated investment across all fund types.

## Country Analysis
Here we analysed top3 English speaking countries for the type of investment suited i.e. Venture. Analysis of the countries is based on with the highest amount of funding for the chosen investment type.

## Sector and Company analysis
Based on the investment type and top countries, below are the top sectors and their respective companies where the investment can be made. In order to do that first we need to melt the mapping sheet and merge with out merged Dataset of companies and round2 tables.

## Conclusion
Based on the understanding of data and graphs it is clear that USA is the best country to make investment, United Kingdom comes after that to make investment and India is on third place.
As we have a amount Spark funds wants to invest is between 5 to 15 million USD per round. We can split our investments based on sectors and English speaking countries.
Attest 60% of the amount can be invested in USA on top 3 sectors among top 2 companies that are : 
Virtustream
SST Inc. (Formerly ShotSpotter) 

Around 40% of the amount can be distributed and can be invested in Great Britain and India on there top sectors and on companies received highest investment :
Electric Cloud -  Can invest around 20% of the total amount.
Celltick Technologies - Can invest around 10% of the total amount.
FirstCry.com - Can invest 7% of the total amount.
GupShup - Can invest 3% of the total amount.
